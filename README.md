# Cataclysm

### Cataclysm is a turn-based strategy two players cooperative game where each player have to manage a tribe in order to rebuild a fortress before a cataclysm occurs.

You will have to manage food and water to feed your members, wood in order to built extension such as field, well or sawmill which will provide your tribe income each turn. It is also and mainly needed to restore the fortress' part which are in ruins at the beginning of the game and are the only solution for the survival of your tribe. You will have to send member through expeditions in order to gather resources and learn how to rebuild the fortress or build tribes' extention. You have 20 turns before the cataclysm arrives and destroy everything on its way. This project was carried out during my first year of study at the school Créajeux (https://www.creajeux.fr/) in 3 months 1 day per week in C language with CSFML library.
